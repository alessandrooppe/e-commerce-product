# E-Commerce Site

This is an e-commerce site where you can view a list of products, filter them, view product details, and add items to the cart.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend**: Manages the APIs for product listing, details, and cart management.
- **Frontend**: User interface built with React to interact with the backend and display products.
